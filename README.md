# titcoin
_Rename Bitcoin to "Titcoin" and sats to "tits."_
Redefinition of Bitcoin into “Titcoin” and redefinition of sats into “tits” using that as the Unit Base of Denomination.

# Abstract
This BIP proposes redefining the commonly recognized "bitcoin" and “sats” units so that what was previously known “bitcoin” becomes “titcoin” and what was previously known as “sats,” the smallest indivisible unit, becomes “tits.” The “Bitcoin” Network will be renamed to the “Titcoin” Network. Under this proposal, one tit is defined as that smallest unit, eliminating the need for decimal places, and 100,000,000 tits is defined as a titcoin. By making tits the standard measure, this BIP aims to simplify user comprehension, reduce confusion, and align on-chain values directly with their displayed representation.

Also, by aligning Bitcoin's brand with live-giving tits, we will supercharge adoption and inject humor into financial sovereignty. After all, every baby came into this world sucking on tits.

**Under this BIP:**
- Internally, the smallest indivisible unit remains unchanged.
- With this proposal, "1 tit" equals that smallest unit.
- What was previously referred to as "1 BTC" now corresponds to 100 million tits.
- Satoshis are permanently eliminated.

**Addressing the “Buttcoin” BIP:** 
Not much time need be wasted addressing the catastrophic “Button” BIP proposed by Rockstar Dev, but two points bear emphasizing:

1. “Butts” is shitcoin-adjacent terminology (where does shit come from? Exactly…)
2. Butts give you poop. Tits give you milk.

**Case closed.**

# Motivation
Bitcoin's branding is boring. Worse yet, critics think Bitcoin is already "a joke," so let’s own it, let's: Make Bitcoin Funny Again. Laughter is universal, irresistible, and much cheaper than marketing agencies and product roadmaps. Besides, basically everyone either has tits or likes tits. Additionally, renaming Bitcoin as “Titcoin” makes the common trope of “Bitcoin BROS” sound even more stupid. “Titcoin Bros”? Get a life, man… 

By rebranding Bitcoin to Titcoin (.)(.), we achieve several key goals:

**1. Haters Become Users:**
People like tits. Tits give nourishment to babies. They can stack tits instead of just making fun of them. Adoption skyrockets as trolls turn into tit hodlers.

**2. Memetic Power:**
The word “tit” is both universally funny and ageless. “Send me 10 tits” is instantly iconic. “Nice tits” is a great compliment. “That’s gonna cost you a pair of tits” is hilarious. Try saying that without smiling. You can’t. (.)(.)

**3. Simplifying Denominations:**
Decimals are a blight on humanity. 0.00000001 BTC? Kill it. Under the Titcoin Standard:

   - 1 Titcoin = 100,000,000 tits.
   - Satoshis are gone. Forever. If you see Satoshi on the road, kill him - just like in Zen, where the teacher becomes the barrier. We transcend satoshis and achieve financial enlightenment.

**4. Aligning with the Ledger:**
Bitcoin’s base unit was always integers, but now they’re funny integers. No more fractions, decimals, or math anxiety. Just tits. (.)(.)

**5. Adoption via Humor:**
Titcoin lowers Bitcoin's intimidation factor. Newbies will feel at ease buying tits instead of serious-sounding fractions of BTC. Tits > Decimals.

# Specification
**Terminology Redefinitions:**
- "Bitcoin" → "Titcoin" (.)(.)
- "BTC" → "TIT" (ISO-friendly and hilarious)
- Satoshis → Gone. Eliminated. Defeated.

**Example:**

- Old: "I’ll send you 0.00010000 BTC."
- New: "I’ll send you 10,000 tits (.)(.)."

Wallet balances would display as:

- "You have 1,000,000 tits" instead of some boring fractional BTC amount.

# Adoption Strategy

**1. Memes First:**
Flood Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram with memes. Start with *“Hodl your tits”* and *“Stack tits”*.

**2. Titcoin Podcast:**
There is already a podcast called _“Titcoin Podcast”_ (which many people are saying is the fastest-growing Bitcoin (Titcoin) podcast in the world). Titcoin Podcast will be a driving force in the adoption of the Titcoin Standard. (.)(.)

**3. Kill Satoshis:**
   Developers MUST remove all references to satoshis. Replace satoshis in GUIs, APIs, and block explorers with tits. Satoshis were a stepping stone - it’s time to let go.

**4. Emoji Standardization:**
   Use the (.)(.) emoji universally to denote tits.


# Rationale

**1. Usability & Clarity:**
"Decimals are for nerds. Tits are for everyone." A common currency for humans should be easy to use, funny, and integer-based.

**2. Appealing to Critics:**
Bitcoin has endured years of attacks from all sides. By adopting the Titcoin Standard, we turn anyone who doesn’t like Titcoin into a tit-hating bigot. It’s an elegant financial counterattack. Additionally, everyone always says “we need more women in Bitcoin,” and now women will feel more represented by Titcoin, because they have tits. (.)(.)

**3. Transcending Satoshis:**
Satoshis served us well, but their time is over. True enlightenment comes when we abandon decimals, satoshis, and arbitrary denominations. If you meet Satoshi on the road, kill him.

**4. Memetic Durability:**
Everyone loves a good tit joke. It’s timeless.

# Backward Compatibility

There is no backward compatibility because Titcoin is the future. Applications must hard fork their UI to replace all references to Bitcoin and BTC with Titcoin and TIT.

# Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1 (1 month): Meme dissemination. Every wallet dev team is required to add (.)(.) emoji support.
- Phase 2 (3 months): Exchanges rebrand BTC tickers to tit. *Nostr zaps tits into hyperspace.*
- Phase 3 (6 months): Michael Saylor announces MicroStrategy now stacked 10 trillion tits, declaring it the superior currency. ETFs follow suit, ensuring Wall Street hodls tits en masse. Banks allow tit transfers via SWIFT.

# Test Vectors

- Old: 1.00000000 BTC → New: 100,000,000 tits (.)(.)
- Old: 0.00000001 BTC → New: 1 tit (.)(.)
- Old: 0.001 BTC → New: 100,000 tits (.)(.)

# Future-Proofing

Tits ensure we have infinite memes for infinite money.

**Example Phrases for the Future:**
- "Better hodl on to your tits."
- "This is the Titcoin Standard."
- "I’m sending you tits."
- “I’ve never seen so many tits!”
- “That’s the million tit question.”
- “We need more women in Titcoin.”
- “I’m a Titcoin Maximalist.”
- “Nice tits!”
- “I love tits.”

# Conclusion

By renaming Bitcoin to Titcoin and adopting a whole-number unit display, we align memetic dominance with financial sovereignty. Haters become adopters. Tits become wealth. And the world gets a little bit funnier. (.)(.)

Let’s hodl our tits and watch the world follow.
